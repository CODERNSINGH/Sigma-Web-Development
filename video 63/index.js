// today we are going to learn about array
// in javaScript type of array is object

let fruits = ['banana','apple','mango']
console.log(fruits.length)

console.log(fruits.unshift('orange'))  //now it'll print new lenth of array

console.log(fruits) //array are mutable means ab array change ho gya hai

let arr = [2,3,4,5,6]
//index =  0,1,2,3,4

//if you want to change array

arr[0] = 33434;
console.log(arr)
